# My .tmux.conf

These settings are great. They've been picked up from around the web and my
tmux setup is something I want to be able to recreate easily, if need be.
Also, if anyone else can benefit from seeing these in one place, all the
better. 

I spend a lot of time in vim, so my brain and fingers are kind of broken. To
keep my terminal navigation productivity up, I've added these things to my
tmux configuration to improve my life. You'll notice that most of these
additions are vim-influenced. 

## Installation instructions
